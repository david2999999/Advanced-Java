Module System
    - Two additional, implicit access levels introduced as part of the module system
        - Public and protected members of unexported packages in a module are inaccessible
          outside the module
        - Within the module, accessibility is unaffected by export declarations
    - Using the module system allows you to share classes among packages within a module
      without making them visible to the entire world
    - Public and protected members of public classes in unexported packages give rise to the
      two implicit access levels, which are intramodular analogues of the normal public and
      protected levels
