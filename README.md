## Java Threads API
The topic of threads is very important in Java - so important that many features of a threaded system
are built into the Java language itself, while other features of a threaded system are required by the
Java virtual machine. Threading is an integral part of using Java.

The concept of threads is not a new one: for some time, many operating systems have had libraries
that provide the C programmer with a mechanism to create threads. Other languages, such as Ada,
have support for threads embedded into the language, much as support for threads is built into the
Java language. Nonetheless, the topic of threads is usually considered a peripheral programming
topic, one that's only needed in special programming cases.

With Java, things are different: it is impossible to write any but the simplest Java program without
introducing the topic of threads. And the popularity of Java ensures that many developers who might
never have considered learning about threading possibilities in a language like C or C++ need to
become fluent in threaded programming.
