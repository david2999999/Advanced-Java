Composition over Inheritance
    - Although inheritance is a powerful way to achieve code reuse, it is not always the best tool
      for the job
        - If used inappropriately, it leads to fragile software
    - It is safe to use inheritance within a package, where the subclass and the superclass
      implementations are under the control of the same programmer
    - It is also safe to use inheritance when extending classes specially designed and documented
      for extension
    - Inheriting from an ordinary concrete classes across package boundaries is dangerous
        - Inheritance in this case, is implementation inheritance
