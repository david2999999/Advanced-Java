// This approach is similar to the public field approach, but it is more concise,
//provides the serialization machinery for free, and provides an ironclad guarantee
//against multiple instantiation, even in the face of sophisticated serialization or
//reflection attacks. This approach may feel a bit unnatural, but a single-element
//enum type is often the best way to implement a singleton. Note that you canâ€™t
//use this approach if your singleton must extend a superclass other than Enum
//(though you can declare an enum to implement interfaces).
