Liskov Substitution Principle
    - If a method overrides a superclass method, it cannot have a more restrictive access level in the subclass
      than in the superclass.
        - This is to ensure that an instance of the subclass is usable anywhere that an instance of the superclass
          is usable
    - The special case of this rule is that if a class implements an interface, all of the class methods that are in
      the interface must be declared as public in the class
