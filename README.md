## Java Threads API
The topic of threads is very important in Java - so important that many features of a threaded system
are built into the Java language itself, while other features of a threaded system are required by the
Java virtual machine. Threading is an integral part of using Java.

The concept of threads is not a new one: for some time, many operating systems have had libraries
that provide the C programmer with a mechanism to create threads. Other languages, such as Ada,
have support for threads embedded into the language, much as support for threads is built into the
Java language. Nonetheless, the topic of threads is usually considered a peripheral programming
topic, one that's only needed in special programming cases.

Java is a multi-threaded programming language which means we can develop multi-threaded program using Java. A multi-threaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently and each part can handle a different task at the same time making optimal use of the available resources specially when your computer has multiple CPUs.

By definition, multitasking is when multiple processes share common processing resources such as a CPU. Multi-threading extends the idea of multitasking into applications where you can subdivide specific operations within a single application into individual threads. Each of the threads can run in parallel. The OS divides processing time not only among different applications, but also among each thread within an application.

Multi-threading enables you to write in a way where multiple activities can proceed concurrently in the same program.
