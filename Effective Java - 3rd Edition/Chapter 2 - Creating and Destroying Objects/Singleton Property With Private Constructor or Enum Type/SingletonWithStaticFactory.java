//The main advantage of the public field approach is that the API makes it clear
//that the class is a singleton: the public static field is final, so it will always
//contain the same object reference. The second advantage is that itâ€™s simpler.
//One advantage of the static factory approach is that it gives you the flexibility
//to change your mind about whether the class is a singleton without changing its
//API. The factory method returns the sole instance, but it could be modified to
//return, say, a separate instance for each thread that invokes it. A second
//advantage is that you can write a generic singleton factory if your application
//requires it (Item 30). A final advantage of using a static factory is that a method
// reference can be used as a supplier, for example Elvis::instance is a
//Supplier<Elvis>. Unless one of these advantages is relevant, the public
//field approach is preferable.
