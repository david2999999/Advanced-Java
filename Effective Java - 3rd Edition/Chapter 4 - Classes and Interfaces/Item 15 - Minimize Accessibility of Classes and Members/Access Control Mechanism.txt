Access Control Mechanism
    - Java provide many facilities to add information hiding
        - One of them is access control mechanism, which specifies the accessibility of classes, interfaces, and members
        - The rule of thumb is to make each class or member as inaccessible as possible
    - Top level classes and interfaces
        - The two possible access levels: package-private and public
        - By making package-private, you make it part of the implementation rather than the exported API, and
          you can modify, replace, eliminate it in a subsequent release without fear of harming existing clients
      - If a package-private top-level class or interface is used by only one class
        - consider making the top-level class a private static nested class of the sole class
        - This reduces its accessibility from all the classes in its package to the one class that uses it

Four Access Levels
    - private - members is accessible only from the top-level class where it is declared
    - package-private - member is accessible from any class in the package where it is declared
        - Also known as default access
    - protected - member is accessible from subclasses of the class where it is declared and any class
                  in the package where it is declared
    - public - member is accessible from anywhere
