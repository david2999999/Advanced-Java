// The lesson is clear: Never put multiple top-level classes or interfaces in a
//single source file. Following this rule guarantees that you canâ€™t have multiple
//definitions for a single class at compile time. This in turn guarantees that the
//class files generated by compilation, and the behavior of the resulting program,
//are independent of the order in which the source files are passed to the compiler.
