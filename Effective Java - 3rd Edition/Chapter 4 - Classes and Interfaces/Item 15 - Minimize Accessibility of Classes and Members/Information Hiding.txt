Information Hiding
    - Well-designed component hides all its implementation details, cleanly separating its API
      from its implementation
    - Components then communicate only through their API and are oblivious to each others' inner workings
        - This is also known as information hiding or encapsulation
    - Information hiding is important for many reasons
        - Decouples the components that comprise a system
            - Allowing them to be developed, tested, optimized, used, understood, and modified in
        - Eases the burden of maintenance
            - Each component can be understood more quickly and debugged or replaced with little fear of harming
              other components
            - Although information hiding does not cause good performance, it enables performance tuning:
                - the components in a system can be optimized without affecting the correctness of others
