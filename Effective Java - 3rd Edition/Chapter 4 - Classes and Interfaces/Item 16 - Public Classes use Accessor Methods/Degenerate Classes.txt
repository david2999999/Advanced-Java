Degenerate Classes
    - Occasionally, we may be tempted to write degenerate classes that serve no purpose
      other than to group instance fields
        - Example: Point class with the public fields x, y
    - The data fields of such classes are accessed directly, these classes do not offer
      the benefits of encapsulation
        - We can not change the representation without changing the API
    - These classes should always be replaced by classes wth private fields and public
      accessor methods
        - If a class is accessible outside its package, provide accessor methods to preserve
          the flexibility to change the class's internal representation
        - If a public class exposes its data fields, all hope of changing its representation
          is lost because client code can be distributed far and wide
