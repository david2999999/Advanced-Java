 //One kind of interface that fails this test is the so-called constant interface.
//Such an interface contains no methods; it consists solely of static final fields,
//each exporting a constant. Classes using these constants implement the interface
//to avoid the need to qualify constant names with a class name

// The constant interface pattern is a poor use of interfaces. That a class uses
//some constants internally is an implementation detail. Implementing a constant
//interface causes this implementation detail to leak into the classâ€™s exported API.
//It is of no consequence to the users of a class that the class implements a
//constant interface. In fact, it may even confuse them. Worse, it represents a
//commitment: if in a future release the class is modified so that it no longer needs
//to use the constants, it still must implement the interface to ensure binary
//compatibility. If a nonfinal class implements a constant interface, all of its
// subclasses will have their namespaces polluted by the constants in the interface.
